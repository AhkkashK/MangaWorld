While Shun's mother wishes for the two to stay, his father remains emotionally disconnected from his son.

Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn't because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him. Prior to Naruto's birth, the powerful and deadly Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village. In order to stop the rampage, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the body of the newborn Naruto.

And so when he is assigned to Team 7—along with his new teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the mentorship of veteran ninja Kakashi Hatake—Naruto is forced to work together with other people for the first time in his life. Through undergoing vigorous training and taking on challenging missions, Naruto must learn what it means to work in a team and carve his own route toward becoming a full-fledged ninja recognized by his village.

But early into her career, Tsunemori encounters a person thought impossible: a criminal with the Psycho-Pass of a righteous man.

""I can't even guess myself what it must be to live the life of a human being.""

Plagued by a maddening anxiety, the terrible disconnect between his own concept of happiness and the joy of the rest of the world, Yozo Oba plays the clown in his dissolute life, holding up a mask for those around him as he spirals ever downward, locked arm-in-arm with death.

120481,Kimi ni wa Todokanai.,"Childhood friends Kakeru Ashiya and Yamato Oohara seem like they would never get along with each other. Kakeru is an amiable student who flunks all of his pop quizzes, and the handsome Yamato is capable of anything other than making friends. Kakeru pays a lot of attention to almost everything his friend does, but he is particularly interested in knowing why Yamato never acknowledges any of the numerous romantic confessions he often gets from girls. Thus, when they are alone in a classroom, Kakeru grabs the opportunity to ask Yamato his meddlesome questions.

Yamato gives him the vaguest of answers and, by impulse, almost lets out a declaration of love toward Kakeru. Although subtle, Kakeru knows deep down that it is a confession—but he stays in denial. Due to this unprecedented incident, Yamato, who has been secretly admiring Kakeru for quite some time, may never reach his heart.

16,Love Hina,"It is said that if a couple gets into the University of Tokyo together, they will live happily ever after. However, for Keitarou Urashima, UTokyo is a distant dream. After failing the entrance exams twice already, he decides to stay at his grandmother's inn in Tokyo in order to prepare for his third attempt. He is, therefore, surprised when he finds out that not only has his grandmother gone on a long vacation, but the inn has also become the Hinata House, an all-girls dormitory!

Unfortunately for Keitarou, a series of misunderstandings during his first visit leave him with five untrusting tenants. But when Haruka Urashima, his aunt who works at the dorm, brings up that he is supposedly a UTokyo student, the girls' impressions of him quickly change, and they reluctantly allow him to stay. Feeling guilty about the lie, he slowly gets to know his new neighbors: the cute yet violent Naru Narusegawa, the cheeky and opportunistic Mitsune Konno, the soft-spoken Shinobu Maehara, the straight-laced Motoko Aoyama, and the mischievous Kaolla Su.

Thus continues the unpopular Keitarou's difficult journey to get into UTokyo, all for the chance to fulfill his childhood promise to the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him and maybe, just maybe, meet her again...
